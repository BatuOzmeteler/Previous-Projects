  abstract = {In this paper, we study a data-enabled predictive control (DeePC) algorithm applied to unknown stochastic linear time-invariant systems. The algorithm uses noise-corrupted input/output data to predict future trajectories and compute optimal control policies. To robustify against uncertainties in the input/output data, the control policies are computed to minimize a worst-case expectation of a given objective function. Using techniques from distributionally robust stochastic optimization, we prove that for certain objective functions, the worst-case optimization problem coincides with a regularized version of the DeePC algorithm. These results support the previously observed advantages of the regularized algorithm. We illustrate the robustness of the regularized algorithm through a numerical case study.},

  abstract = {In a paper by Willems et al., it was shown that persistently exciting data can be used to represent the input-output behavior of a linear system. Based on this fundamental result, we derive a parametrization of linear feedback systems that paves the way to solve important control problems using data-dependent linear matrix inequalities only. The result is remarkable in that no explicit system's matrices identification is required. The examples of control problems we solve include the state and output feedback stabilization, and the linear quadratic regulation problem. We also discuss robustness to noise-corrupted measurements and show how the approach can be used to stabilize unstable equilibria of nonlinear systems.},

  abstract = {The use of persistently exciting data has recently been popularized in the context of data-driven analysis and control. Such data have been used to assess system-theoretic properties and to construct control laws, without using a system model. Persistency of excitation is a strong condition that also allows unique identification of the underlying dynamical system from the data within a given model class. In this article, we develop a new framework in order to work with data that are not necessarily persistently exciting. Within this framework, we investigate necessary and sufficient conditions on the informativity of data for several data-driven analysis and control problems. For certain analysis and design problems, our results reveal that persistency of excitation is not necessary. In fact, in these cases, data-driven analysis/control is possible while the combination of (unique) system identification and model-based control is not. For certain other control problems, our results justify the use of persistently exciting data, as data-driven control is possible only with data that are informative for system identification.},
