Program Description: This program takes an input in the form of an integer and checks if it's
a Fibonacci Number while printing every single Fibonacci Number smaller than it.

"""

index1 = 0 #Indexes that indicate which numbers are summed up 
index2 = 1 #to calculate the next Fibonacci Number
list = [0,1] #the list where the numbers are kept
while list[-1] < fibonacciNumber: #if the last element is bigger than our input, loop breaks
    list.append(list[index1]+list[index2]) #appending the last calculated Fibonacci Number 
    index1 = index1 + 1 #incrementation of 
    index2 = index2 + 1 #the indexes

print(list)
